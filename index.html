			<p>Bla bla HTML DOESN'T PROVIDE A HUGE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS for
			us to work with. The selection available is more like that of a
			corner store than a Walmart.
			We have paragraphs, lists, and headlines but we don't have
			events, news stories, or recipes. HTML gives us an element
			for marking up a string as an abbreviation, but it doesn't give
			us an element for marking up a number as a price.
			Clearly, this limitation hasn't been a show-stopper; just look
			at the amazing variety of websites out there. Even though
			HTML might not provide a specific element for marking up a
			particular piece of content, it provides just enough flexibility
			to be "good enough."</p>
