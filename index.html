        	<h2> SCRUM </h2>
			<p>HTML DOESN'T PROVIDE A HUGE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS for
			us to work with. The selection available is more like that of a
			corner store than a Walmart.
			We have paragraphs, lists, and headlines but we don't have
			events, news stories, or recipes. HTML gives us an element
			for marking up a string as an abbreviation, but it doesn't give
			us an element for marking up a number as a price.
			Clearly, this limitation hasn't been a show-stopper; just look
			at the amazing variety of websites out there. Even though
			HTML might not provide a specific element for marking up a
			particular piece of content, it provides just enough flexibility
			to be "good enough."</p>
            
            <p> For many people, understanding the e-learning modules, the Scrum Reference Card, 
            and the Agile Manifesto will be sufficient to pass a certification test. 
            If you find a good Scrum trainer, you'll spend most of your class time in 
            interactive team activities going beyond the basic concepts into practical application 
            and case studies. (According to Yogi Berra, "In theory there's no difference between 
            theory and practice. In practice, there is.") Some trainers (including our competitors) 
            require completion of this e-learning series before class so that more time can be 
            spent on more advanced activities. A good trainer will check your understanding more 
            thoroughly than these modules can. While some people do get good at doing Scrum and 
            Agile without any training, our participants report training helps them get better at it faster. </p>
