			<p>HTML DOESN'T PROVIDE A HUGE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS for
			us to work with. The selection available is more like that of a
			corner store than a Walmart.
			We have paragraphs, lists, and headlines but we don't have
			events, news stories, or recipes. HTML gives us an element
			for marking up a string as an abbreviation, but it doesn't give
			us an element for marking up a number as a price.
			Clearly, this limitation hasn't been a show-stopper; just look
			at the amazing variety of websites out there. Even though
			HTML might not provide a specific element for marking up a
			particular piece of content, it provides just enough flexibility
			to be "good enough."</p>

			<h2>EXTENSIBILITY</h2>
			<p>Other markup languages allow you to invent any element
			you want. In XML, if you want an event <span>element</span> or a <span>price</span>
			element, you just go right ahead and create it. The downside
			to this freedom is that you then have to teach a parser what
			<span>event</span> or <span>price</span> means. The advantage to HTML's limited set
			of elements is that every user agent knows about every ele
			ment. Browsers have a built-in knowledge of HTML. That
			wouldn't be possible if we were allowed to make up element
			names.
			HTML provides a handy escape clause that allows web de
			signers to add more semantic value to elements: the <span>class</span>
			attribute. This attribute allows us to label specific instances
			of an element as being a special class or type of that element.
			The fact that browsers don't understand the vocabulary we
			use in our <span>class</span> attributes doesn't affect the rendering of our
			documents.
			If, at this point, you're thinking "Wait a minute; aren't classes
			for CSS?" then you're half right. The CSS class selector is one
			example of a technology that makes use of the class attribute
			but it isn't the onlyreason for using classes. Classes can also be
			used in DOM Scripting. They can even be used by browsers
			if the <span>class</span> names follow an agreed convention, as is the case
			with microformats.</p>

			<h3>Microformats</h3>
			<p>Microformats are a set ofconventions which are agreed upon
			by a community. These formats use the class attribute to plug
			some of the more glaring holes in HTML: hCard for contact
			details, hCalendar for events, hAtom for news stories. Because
			there is a community consensus on what class names to use,
			there are now parsers and browser extensions that work with
			those specific patterns.</p>
